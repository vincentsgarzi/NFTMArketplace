to run (temp for notekeeping)

- Upload contract in  *.sol to remix - compile with 0.5.17
- Quick start Ethereum workspace in Ganache
- Deploy the contract with Dev-Ganache
- Obtain the deployed contract address  and save it in .env (as SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
- .env should also contain -  WEB3_PROVIDER_URI (from Ganache, i think the standard value for temp workspace is HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545), PINATA_API_KEY & PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY
